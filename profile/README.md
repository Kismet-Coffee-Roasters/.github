# Our Story
At Kismet Coffee Roasters, our story began in the most unlikely of places: a day job discussing the impending closure of a coffee roasting hobby. Two friends decided to turn this challenge into an opportunity. Fueled by a shared passion for exceptional coffee, we joined forces to transform the fading hobby into a vibrant and thriving coffee company. Today, Kismet Coffee Roasters proudly offers an array of premium coffee and K-Cup options, delighting every coffee lover with each sip. Our journey is a testament to the power of friendship, resilience, and the belief that the best things in life often come from unexpected beginnings.
